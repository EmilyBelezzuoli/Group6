//Sleep Depravision Research:

// It is when an individual fails to get the amount of sleep they need;
// - If occurs due to carious lifestyle,work and enviromental factors. -

// It can cause major impact on daytime funcationing such as...
// - poor concentration,reduced reaction time, altered moods, and school/work performances

// It is a condition characterised by inadequate or insufficient sleep sustained over a period of time. 

//Sleep is a vital physiological process that allows the body and brain to rest, recover and perform essential functions including memory consolidation, emotional regulation, immune function and general health maintenance.
//Sleep deprivation can lead to poor short-term and long-term health outcomes as well as impair everyday functioning.


// The recommended amount of sleep is 9-11 hours for school age children, 8-10 for teens, 
// 7-9 for adults aged 18-64 and 7-8 for older adults (65 and over).

// CAUSES
//Lifestyle behavior  -  Voluntary choices that reduce time available for sleep and having inconsistent bed and wake times, use of electronic late nigt
//Sleep Enviroment - uncomforable sleep enviroment Environmental factors such as heat or cold as well as noise can have a major impact on the quality and consistency of sleep.
//Work - Shit work an lead to sleep deprivation. Shift work can alter our natural circadian rhythms (our biological clock that regulates alertness and sleepiness, hunger, temperature and hormone levels).
// Sleep Disorders- sleep aponea, snoring , insomnia, restless leg syndrom, bruxism ( grinding your teeth)
//Medical Conditions - chronic pain, mental health, nocuria, diabetes, medication,alcohol, illicit substances and addiction

//Symptoms of Sleep Deprivation
// - falling asleep when not intended
// - falling asleep quickly once on bed
// - sleeping long hours on the weekend
// - taking naps

// - changes in the way you feel
// - feelling fatigued or lethargic throughout the day, yawning frequently
// - feeling irritable 
// - change in mood
// - low motivation
// less intreseted in sex
//sleep paralysis

// IMPACT ON BRAIN
//Insufficient sleep can impact your brainâ€™s functioning including your ability to remember, 
//regulate emotion and attention, the speed you process information and the ability to have insight.
// Even short-term sleep deprivation can impair these functions.

//SLEEP RECOMMENDATIONS
// Prioritise your sleep:Due to lifestyle choices, leisure activities, and other obligations we sometimes do not prioritise our sleep.
//Bed and wake up times: Go to bed and wake up at the same times each day, even on weekends ensuring you get enough sleep. This will help with maintain a good circadian rhythm (the biological clock that dictates multiple processes in the body, including alertness and sleepiness).
//Time Allocated to sleep:Make sure you allow enough time obtain the full amount of sleep you need for each night.
//Bedtime Routine: Maintain a quiet, steady bedtime routine. This will put you in the right frame of mind to sleep.
//Sleeping Enviorment: f it is possible, have a comfortable bedroom environment (e.g., comfortable bedding and pillow and room temperature and quiet and dark as possible).
//Sunlight: Getting frequent sunlight exposure during the day supports a healthy circadian rhythm that helps you be alert during the day and sleepy at night.
//Physical Activitys: Try to engage in regular physical activity. Physical activity can improve your sleep quality at night and contribute to a normal sleep schedule.
//Avoid things the will disrupt your sleep
//Alchol:While drinking alcohol may make some people sleepy, consuming alcohol before bed can result in a poor quality sleep.
//Napping:Napping frequently and more that 30 minutes per day. Avoid napping in the late afternoon or evening. 
//Caffenie:Consuming caffeine before bedtime. High doses of caffeine can remain in your body system for hours and make it harder to fall and stay asleep.
//Electronic Devices:Use of electronic devices at night (e.g. TVs, smartphones, tablets, computers). Blue light emitted from electronic devices can interfere with melatonin levels, a hormone that makes you feel sleepy at night-time and is essential for regulation of day/night sleep patterns.
